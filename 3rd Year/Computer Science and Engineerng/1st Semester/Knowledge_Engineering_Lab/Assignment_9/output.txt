Created Decision Tree according to splits in preorder:-
[NODE_NAME->(age) its branches:{branch1->(youth)->[NODE_NAME->(student) its branches:{branch1->(yes)->[NODE_NAME->(Class:buys_computer) its branches:{}],branch2->(no)->[NODE_NAME->(Class:buys_computer) its branches:{}],}],branch2->(middle_aged)->[NODE_NAME->(Class:buys_computer) its branches:{}],branch3->(senior)->[NODE_NAME->(credit_rating) its branches:{branch1->(fair)->[NODE_NAME->(Class:buys_computer) its branches:{}],branch2->(excellent)->[NODE_NAME->(Class:buys_computer) its branches:{}],}],}]

Given testing set and their estimated class label 
	Estimated_Class 
senior	low	no	fair	no	yes

middle_aged	low	yes	fair	yes	yes

Given predict sample and their predicted class label:
yes	 predicted_class 
senior	high	yes	fair	yes
youth	high	yes	fair	yes
middle_aged	low	no	excellent	yes
