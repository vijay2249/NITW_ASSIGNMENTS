Space Complexity:
  n = size of file
  m = lines in the file
  Saving the File = O(3*n)
  Opening the file = O(n)
  Saving the data into temp Variables = O(9*m + constant_for_temp_variables)

Time Complexity:
  n = size of file
  m = size of vector = lines in a file
  reading the file and output the file  = O(4*n)
  N1- method:
    O(12*m)
  N2-method:
    O(9*m+3)
  N3-method:
    O(3*(log(data_len_in_vector)+4*m))
