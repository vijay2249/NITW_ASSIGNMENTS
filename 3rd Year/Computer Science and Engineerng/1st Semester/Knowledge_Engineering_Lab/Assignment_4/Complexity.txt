Complexity Analysis:

n-> length of file(input file)

Question-1:
  Time Complexity: O(n)
  Space Complexity: O(n)
  For all three output files

Question-2:
  Time Complexity: 5*O(n) + O(nlogn) = max(O(n), O(n*logn))
  Space Complexity: 
    output file : 3*O(n)
    Sorting : O(nlogn)

Question-3:
  Class list is done based of numbers in the range 5 like from 1-5 and 6-10 and 11-15 etc..
  Space Complexity:
    Reading file - O(3*n)
    calculate mean for each class set - O(class_set_size*t) t-> avg size of data[i]
    Output file - O(n)
  
  Time Complexity:
    Reading - O(n)
    calculate mean for each class set - O(class_set_size*t) t-> avg size of data[i]
    Output file - O(n)
