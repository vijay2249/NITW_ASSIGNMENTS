    1. Implement Hash Based technique to extract frequent itemsets on Static Transaction Database for 2-length and 3-length itemsets with minimum support=3
        a. Consider hash function (x*10+y)%7 for length (x*10-y*5+z)%7
        b. Consider you own hash functions.
    2. Implement Partition Based Algorithm on Static Transaction Database with minimum support=35%
